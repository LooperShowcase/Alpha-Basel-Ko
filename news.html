      NET It has been an absolutely off-the-wall year for Apple news. I was
      genuinely impressed by how many surprises the company packed into 2023 and
      I'm not just talking about the usual upgraded iPhones and MacBooks. I've
      been a tech reporter for over 15 years and Apple is a

      Apple threw a ton of unexpected news nuggets our way. So let's look back
      at the biggest Apple news that happened in 2023 and the stories that will
      shape our world going forward.

      What makes the Vision Pro extra special is that there's been so much
      buildup. But it's not the first time we've waited for a new Apple product
      to launch after its announcement. The first iPhone was announced at
      MacWorld in January 2007, but didn't launch for another six months. When
      the iPad was announced in January 2010, it wasn't released until April and
      the Apple Watch was unveiled in September 2014 but wentWhat makes the

      The past six months have included a lot of Vision Pro teases and developer
      testing. The tech involved does make it a more ambitious product than the
      first iPhone, iPad or Watch. While there's still a lot to learn about how it
      works in the real world, you can be certain that the Vision Pro is going to
      shape every Apple conversation in some fashion for the foreseeable future.
      Now, we just have to patiently wait until it is ready to launch in early 2024.

    Apple also launched two new financial products. The first was a high-yield
    savings account for Apple credit card customers. Then there was the rollout of
    Apple Pay Later that gives people the option to pay for purchases with a series
    of four installments over the course of six weeks

      Next year, we could find out which company will be taking over Apple's credit card and savings account business. Chase and American Express are a couple of the names analysts hope are in the running.
    
    But it's not great to announce a new product like the Apple Card savings account and read news that your partner wants to leave the deal all in the same <year class="v"></year>

  The iPhone had its own slew of changes and additions that shook up the norm. On the iPhone 15, Apple made the switch from lightning to USB-C charging ports. That happened because the European Union adopted a law that made USB-C charging mandatory on all phones and other small devices by 2024. That change alone will shape how we spend money on charging cords and other related accessories that get updated.

But there could be another large change coming to your iPhone next year. As first reported by 9to5Mac, the iPhone will support RCS messaging in 2024. That means texts between Android and Apple users can show typing indicators, read receipts and even be more secure.

This also was the first year we saw an entire Apple presentation video that was shot on iPhone. The Scary Fast October event was recorded with iPhone 15 Pro Max cameras. Apple was transparent on how it used a lot of professional gear to make that magic happen, but it showed any doubters that the iPhone 15 Pro really can do it all.

The HomePod strikes back
Apple Homepod mini
The new HomePod now features an edge-to-edge Siri display
Chris Monroe/CNET
This year saw the surprising return of the HomePod speaker. Apple's original smart home speaker debuted in 2018 for $350. A price cut followed, and in 2021 Apple said it was discontinuing the device, shifting focus to the more colorful and more affordable HomePod Mini.

But in January, Apple took us all by surprise with the introduction of a second-gen model of the HomePod. It looks nearly identical to the original, but changes on the inside improved the sound. The company has been presenting the speakers as something that makes for a better home theater experience with the Apple TV 4K box.

This proves that Apple could make anything return. Will the iPod make a comeback? Hey, it could happen, but it may take a different form.

  Apple also said it's making the iPhone with more recycled materials and that it had stopped selling leather accessories in stores. It released a replacement product called FineWoven. The pitch was that a FineWoven case would be a more environmentally friendly alternative to a leather iPhone case as it's made of 68% postconsumer recycled content.
  But when Apple makes a product to replace leather and it costs $60, high hopes follow. Once we got the case in our hands, things quickly went south. The FineWoven case doesn't feel as nice as a leather one and it gets marked up easily, leading to a big ol' FineWoven flop for Apple.

      In 2023, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman revealed the existence of Apple's Exploratory Design Group (XDG), which was working to add glucose monitoring to the Apple Watch. Gurman compared XDG to Alphabet's X "moonshot factory".[275]
